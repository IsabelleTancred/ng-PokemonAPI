# PokemonAPI

##Project Description 
This project was an assignment at Experis Academy. The goal was to build a Pokémon Trainer web app using the Angular Framework. 

The web app has a **LogIn-page** where the user needs to enter a valid username to move forward. Once logged in, the user can view the **pokemon-catalogue** wish is a list of all pokemon avaliable. The user have the option to catch any pokemon they want by using the catch button. If the user change their mind they can throw the pokemon again. All pokemons that have been caught are visible on the **trainer-page**.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
